Transparency â€“ the provision of information about what personal data is collected for which purposes, how long it is stored, or to which parties it is transferred â€“ is one of the core privacy principles underlying regulations such as the GDPR. Technical approaches for implementing transparency in practice are, however, only rarely considered. In this paper, we present a novel approach for doing so in current, RESTful application architectures and in line with prevailing agile and DevOps-driven practices. For this purpose, we introduce 1) a transparency-focused extension of OpenAPI specifications that allows individual service descriptions to be enriched with transparency-related annotations in a bottom-up fashion and 2) a set of higher-order tools for aggregating respective information across multiple, interdependent services and for coherently integrating our approach into automated CI/CD-pipelines. Together, these building blocks pave the way for providing transparency information that is more specific and at the same time better reflects the actual implementation givens within complex service architectures than current, overly broad privacy statements.

## Personal data indicators
To learn more about where personal data indicators in OpenAPI specifications may reside, see **[here](docs/PD_INDICATORS.md)**.

## Vocabulary
To learn more about our vocabulary used for the proposed OpenAPI extension, see **[here](docs/VOCABULARY.md)**.

## Installation

Make sure Ruby is installed.

```bash
ruby --version
```

Tira was built using Ruby version `2.6.3`, Other/newer versions should work fine, but were not tested against.

Install bundler

```bash
gem install bundler
```

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PrivacyEngineering/tira.git
cd tira/
```

Install all gems via bundler

```bash
bundle install
```

Configure secrets and credentils 

```bash
bin/rails credentials:edit
```

Rails tries to open the crendentials with `$EDITOR`.
You can define an editor by setting the `EDITOR` variable explicitely, e.g.

```bash
EDITOR="nano" rails credentials:edit
```


This will create an encrypted config file and a master key, for details visit [this guide](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-credentials).
The configuration format used can be found in the sample configuration file in `config/credentials_example.yml`.

Database name and credentials need to be configured.
If a different database adapter than postgres is used, this must be configured in:

```
config/database.yml
```


Set up a postgres database (if you chose to not use postgres, set up a database according to your configuration).

You can use the offical docker image

```bash
docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
```

or set up a postgres database locally

```psql
create database $db_name;

create role $user_name with createdb login password 'password';

grant all privileges on database $db_name to $user_name;

```

Now run the migrations to set up the database

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
```


TransparencyHub is now set up and you can start the application

```bash
rails s
```

The app is now accessible via `http://localhost:3000`


## Example of *x-tira* in an OpenAPI document
We describe a `ToothbrushEvent` that can be shared with other utilizers via the example service from our paper. 

```yaml
